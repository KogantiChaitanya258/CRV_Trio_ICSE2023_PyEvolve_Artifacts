1. A machine that has [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) downloaded and intalled. 
2. An internet connection is required. 
4. A PC with at least 40 GB of free memory
5. We have generated a VirtualBox image on a Mac computer with an Intel chip. The evaluation process heavily relies on the ability to load and run the virtual machine, which may pose challenges as VirtualBox is known to have specific issues with certain operating systems. To mitigate this, we succesfully tested the image on following machines. 

      1. Mac with Intel chip
      2. Windows-10
      
    We have encountered a known bug, which is not under our control, that prevents the loading of VirtualBox images created on Mac-Intel chips onto Mac- M1/M2 chips. This may cause issues during the evaluation. To ensure a successful evaluation of the tool, we recommend not using Mac computers with M1/M2 chips. 
    

6. Access to Google Drive
7. Please begin downloading the image by using one of the links provided. The VirtualBox image is 19 GB in size. It might take some time to download depending on the internet speed.
We have uploaded it to multiple locations to ensure that if one link is not working, you can try another.
