1. A machine that has [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) downloaded and intalled. 
2. An internet connection is required. 
3. The evaluation process heavily relies on the ability to load and run the virtual machine, which may pose challenges as VirtualBox is known to have specific issues with certain operating systems. We have generated a VirtualBox image on a Mac computer with an Intel processor. However, there is a known bug that hinders the loading of images created on Mac-Intel chips onto Mac computers that utilize the M1 or M2 chip, which may cause problems during the evaluation. To guarantee a successful testing of the tool, we strongly recommend that the reviewer uses a **Mac computer with an Intel processor** as the VirtualBox image has not been tested on other operating systems.
6. A PC with at least 40 GB of free memory
7. Access to Google Drive
8. Please begin downloading the image by using one of the links provided. The VirtualBox image is 19 GB in size. It might take some time to download depending on the internet speed.
We have uploaded it to multiple locations to ensure that if one link is not working, you can try another.
