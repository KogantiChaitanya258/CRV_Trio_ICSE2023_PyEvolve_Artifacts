1. A machine that has [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) downloaded and intalled. 
2. An internet connection is required. 
3. Loading and running the virtual machine is a crucial step in the evaluation process and it may present some challenges as VirtualBox is known to have issues specific to certain operating systems. We have created a VirtualBox image on a Mac computer with an Intel processor. There is a known bug that prevents these images from being loaded onto Mac computers that use the M1 or M2 chip, which can lead to issues during the evaluation. To ensure a smooth testing experience for the tool, we highly recommend that the reviewer uses a **Mac computer with an Intel processor** as we have not tested the image 
6. A PC with at least 40 GB of free memory
7. Access to Google Drive
8. Please begin downloading the image by using one of the links provided. The VirtualBox image is 19 GB in size. It might take some time to download depending on the internet speed.
We have uploaded it to multiple locations to ensure that if one link is not working, you can try another.
