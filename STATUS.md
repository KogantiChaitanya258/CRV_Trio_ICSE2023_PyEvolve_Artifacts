We would like to claim the badges **Available**, and **Reusable**

In our paper, [PYEVOLVE: Automating Frequent Code Changes in Python ML Systems](https://danny.cs.colorado.edu/papers/PyEvolve_ICSE2023.pdf), we present a tool called [PyEvolve](https://github.com/maldil/PyEvolve) for automating code changes in Python systems. To evaluate the effectiveness of PyEvolve, we used two datasets: 1) a dataset of 40,000 transformation trials and 2) a dataset of 40 pull requests submitted to open-source repositories. 

### **Available**

The tool and data are summarized on the main website ([https://mlcodepatterns.github.io](https://pythoninfer.github.io)), which allows for easy public access.

Following the ICSE 2022 Open Science Policies, we have archived the tool and data in Zenodo.

* Tool : The `Tool` folder in https://zenodo.org/record/7566407#.Y9HorC1h1hF
* Data: The `Data` folder in https://zenodo.org/record/7566407#.Y9HorC1h1hF

### **Reusable**
The GitHub repository of [PyEvolve](https://github.com/maldil/PyEvolve) includes detailed instructions for 1) building the tools, 2) using the APIs, and 3) utilizing them as VirtualBox image. The detailed instructions are open to the public, allowing other researchers to reuse the tools and data. Â Furthermore, the [README.md](https://github.com/maldil/ICSE2023_PyEvolve_Artifacts/blob/master/README.md) of this repository explains the steps that must be taken in order to determine whether the tools are functional.
